# Assign the value "Tim" to the variable name
name = "Tim"
age = 16

# Say hello
print("Hello!")

# Ask the user how old they are
#   - overwrite the value in the age variable
#   - use the input() function
age = input("How old are you? ")

# Tell the user how old they are
#   - You'll need to use the age variable
#   - You'll need to use f-strings
print(f"You are {age} years old!!!!!!!")

# Ask the user for their name
# Store it in a variable
print("So... what's your name?")
name = input()

# Greet the user using their name
print(f"It's nice to meet you {name}!")
